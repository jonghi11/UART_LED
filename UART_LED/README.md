# UART_LED

This is an UART-driver meant to be compatible with a STM32(STM32F411x) board microcontroller.

This is project made for training purposes for Embedded Systems with the UART-protocol.

Languages used:
  1. C
  2. C++



To implement this driver to you will need:
  1. A compatible IDE such as CubeIDE(STM32)
  2. UART cable
  3. STM32F411x HAL library
  4. STM32F411x board(microcontroller)

Feel free to clone this repository using "git clone" and copy the HTTPS in your terminal/CMD from this repository for necessary files.

To run it on a IDE compatible for a STM32 board(CubeIDE) with the necessary HAL libraries
Initialize the UART peripheral using the USART2_Init() and pass in required configurations.
